## Array in TypeScript:  
- An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored together.  
- It allows storing and manipulating a list of values.  
- Arrays can be declared using square brackets (e.g., `number[]`) or the `Array` type (e.g., `Array<number>`).  
- They support several built-in methods like `push` (to add an element), `pop` (to remove the last element), `map` (to transform each element), and more.
